#Island Attack
**Side:** Allies
**Add-on required:** none

**Description:** Allied forces have taken over Moscow. The USSR is ours. We are now combing through all of the USSR, seeing if we can find any more Soviet bases. We have now found what is the last remianing Soviet base. It is situated on a small Island on the East coast, near Japan. The only thing that links the Island from the mainland is a small sandbank 
which is usually flooded. The Soviets also have the biggest amount of subs that I have ever known situated here. Because this area is so far east of any of our main bases, we have hardly anything in the area. Your job is to make sure this base is obliterated, and every last sub is sunk, and that every last unit is dead or destroyed.
