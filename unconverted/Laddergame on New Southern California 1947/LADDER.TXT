Tips: (only read this when you want to win easily)
- Play Easy mode if you are new to Red Alert
- To beat the computer just build several Construction Yards and defend your base with many teslas.
Make sure you repair the teslas (engineers?) and watch the computer losing dozens of tanks.
Or attack early in the game with 5 heavies and destroy some important buildings.
