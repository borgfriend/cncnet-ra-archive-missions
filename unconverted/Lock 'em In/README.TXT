Red Alert Single Player Scenario - By Richard Ling
--- ----- ------ ------ --------

Name:           LOCK 'EM IN

Objective:      Destroy all bridges, Destroy all units and keep all the
                structures intact.

Full Briefing:

  One of our recon teams have reported a main Soviet supply depot hidden
in the mountains. Spies report that for some reason all the supplies are
being readied for transport to a nearby base. We musn't let Stalin get
those supplies. This could turn the tables dramatically! Our main army cant
get there before the supplies are transported. So, take Tanya and destroy
all bridges to their base. This will stop the convoy from leaving the depot
until our armies can arrive. Also take out any units that may hinder our
progress. This includes the convoy trucks. Our spies have managed to
sabotage the trucks with explosives. Shoot them once and they'll blow. Keep
ALL the structures intact! We may be able to use these supplies and buildings
to our advantage! You must keep Tanya alive and you cannot afford to fail.
Beware, though, all the troops in the area have binoculars and will see
you coming, possibly before you see them! Good Luck!

Description:

  This is a level for the allies and is called "Lock 'Em In". You have only
Tanya to do this mission. Do as the briefing instructs and your mission will
end successfully when all units and bridges have been destroyed. You will
fail your mission if you destroy ANY structure!
