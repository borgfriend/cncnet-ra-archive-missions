1=One of our recon teams have found a secret supply dump hidden in the
2=valleys. Our spies say that the supplies are about to be moved to another
3=base. We cant let Stalin get those supplies. Our armies cant get to
4=the supply dump before the supplies are transported. Take Tanya and remove
5=all the bridges to the base and all enemy units. But leave ALL the buildings
6=intact! We could use these supplies! Once the Soviets are trapped on their
7=own island we will move in and mop up. Keep Tanya alive at all costs.
