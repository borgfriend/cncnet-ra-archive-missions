2=By a small town in Germany, there is an island called
3=Skull Island. A road runs through this area and is used
4=as a major supply route.  Recently, all supply shipments
5=sent through this area have been disappearing.  The 
6=townspeople have reported anomalies as well.  You are to
7=investigate what is going on here. Set up your base
8=and await further instructions.  Good luck. @
9=Intelligence has found that the Soviets are setting up
10=a base here as well.  No doubt they also want to investigate
11=these strange occurrences.  There isn't a lot of ore in the
12=area, except in the mountains on the west, and a huge ore
13=field by the town.  The townspeople are unnerved by all the
14=military activity, and are jealously guarding this ore
15=deposit.
