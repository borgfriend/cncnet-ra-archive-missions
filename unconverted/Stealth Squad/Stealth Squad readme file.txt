BUGS LIST (READ IT):
I fixed almost everything in this version (A lot of help from Osprey and Gavin
Pugh there is only one bug left (as far as I know):
When uploading your commando into the chinook the chinoo will try to go
out of the screen because it thinks that he is a civilian and it tries
to evacuate him. This is strange because in the basic section I set 
CivEvac=no. I tried to overcome it by using another unit and giving it the
image and the info of the commando but it doesn't seem to work and I get the
normal image of the unit.
I decided to leave it as it is and to slow down the chinook so you will
have more time to move it somewhere else. By moving it to another point of
the screen the chinook will obey you until you upload the commando again.
I'm really sorry about it and if someone can help me out I would be really
glad.

MISSION BRIEFING:
Our spies have discovered that the allies are working on a new stealth
device and the process is near completion. If the operation is completed no 
force will be able to stop them. We need to get this device NOW!
Device is stored within a crate in a small isolated Allies outpost. You
will be enforced with our new commando unit and with a chinook. They will
greatly assist you in your mission. After retieving the device we need
you to destroy remaining Allied forces.
Exposion to the device in the crate can lead to interesting results, so be 
careful when taking it.
Make sure that the commando and the chopper will return safely to our base
in Moscow. Without the commando, we will never be able to find what the 
Allies are up to. Without the chinook, we can't get him back. Lose them, and
you will lose your life.
