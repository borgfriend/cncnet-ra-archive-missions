INTRODUCTION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my sixth mission.  This is my first using RACK.  It's a good 
program. Gavin Pugh has done a fine job.  I don't know of any bugs, but 
if you find any please E-mail me.

THEME:  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You are to repair our base and protect the civilians.  Then
destroy the Soviets.  You may want to take over the Turkish base to make 
things easier.

INCLUDED FILES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Read Me.txt (this document)
scg01ea.ini  (the new scenario)
mission.ini  (the new mission briefing)

INSTALLATION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Just place the "scg01ea.ini" file and the mission.ini file in the same 
directory that RED ALERT is in.  Then start RED ALERT.  Select
"NEW GAME".  You should choose normal difficulty.  Then select Allies
and my mission is loaded.  

UNINSTALLATION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Just place the files in a different directory.
