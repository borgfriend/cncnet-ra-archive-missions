#Beginning of a New Technology (updated)
**Side:** Soviet
**Add-on required:** Aftermath
**Date Added:** 30-Jan-2014
**Author:** Alley (T_Alj5)

**Description:** This nice campaign replaces 4 soviet aftermath missions. Each mission have been meant to be like a game in skirmish or online mode. Only thing is that the AI&apos;s side, technology and behaviour is different. Tasks comes in by a person who try to be like a common bulling top commander online. RaZor comment: I have repacked it to make it work with original RA Aftermath. Sorry Alley, but we should respect oldschool RA players too!
