GENERAL:
This is a small campaign of three missions where you play the Ants.
Therefore, to play you will need to have the Counter Strike (CS) add-on 
(or may be the patch upgrade.)

From there the progression is much the same as the actual Ant missions
included in the official CS disk. In a similar fashion, you will not be 
taken to the scorescreen, or the Map select screen but proceed directly
to the next level.
