; ******* AI Controls *******
; Computer Skirmish-Mode behavior controls. The ratio values are based on

; try to grow as it vainly attempts to achieve the specified percentage 
; composition.

; Take note: The computer AI in Red Alert is merely a warmed over version
; of the AI experiment I wrote during the unallocated time in the month
; following C&C's release. It was more than adequate at that time (even
; difficult to beat), but since Red Alert is a very different game, the 
; skirmish mode AI is somewhat under-effective. In order to improve the AI
; over this initial experiment, the following controls are provided. It

; ******* IQ setting for computer activity *******
; Each player (computer controlled or otherwise) is given an IQ rating 
; that is used to control what the computer is allowed to automatically 
; control. This is distinct from the difficulty setting. The higher the IQ 
; setting, the more autonomous and intelligent the side will behave. Each 
; ability is given a rating that indicates the IQ level (or above) that the 
; ability will be granted. Because such abilities are automatically 
; performed by the computer, giving a human controlled country a high IQ is
; not recommended. Otherwise the player's units will start to
; automatically "do their own thing"! A human controlled country is 
; presumed to have an IQ rating of zero. A computer controlled country has 
; an IQ of 1 or higher. When in skirmish mode or when multiplayer AIs are 
; active, the computer IQ is set to the maximum.

; ******* Difficulty Settings *******
; Game difficulty is controlled by these factors. Some of these factors 
; will only affect a computer player. The computer and the player are 
; handicapped by individual settings. Thus the computer may be playing at 
; 'difficult' level while the player may be playing at 'easy' level.

; Airspeed = multiplier to speed for all air units (def=1.0)
; Armor = multiplier to armor strength for all units and buildings (def=1.0)
; Cost = multiplier to cost for all units and buildings (def=1.0)
; Firepower = multiplier to firepower for all weapons (def=1.0)
; Groundspeed = multiplier to speed for all ground units (def=1.0)
; ROF = multiplier to Rate Of Fire for all weapons (larger means slower ROF)
; BuildSlowdown = Should the computer build slower than the player? (def=no)
;
;  <<< the following affects the computer player, not the human player >>>
; ContentScan = Should the contents of a transport be considered when 
;   picking best target (def=no)?
; RepairDelay = average delay (minutes) between initiating building repair
; BuildDelay = average delay (minutes) between initiating construction
; DestroyWalls = Allow scanning for nearby enemy walls and destroy them
;   (def=yes)?

; ******* Unit Statistics *******
; Specifies the characteristics of the various game objects.
;
; Ammo = number of rounds carried between reloads (-1 means unlimited)
;   (def=-1) (ie like helicopters, migs, and yaks)
;
; Armor = the armor type of this object (none,wood,light,heavy,concrete) 
;   (def=none)
;
; Cloakable = Is it equipped with a cloaking device (def=no)?
;   NOTE: the cloaking device in this game is the Submarine surfacing
;   complete with sound effect NOT the cloaking of C&C. It can be added to
;   units but it's a little strange to hear that surfacing sound effect
;
; Cost = cost to build object (in credits)
;
; Explodes = Does it explode violently when destroyed (i.e., does it do 
;   collateral damage) (def=no)? (ie usually only flamer types)
;
; GuardRange = distance to scan for enemies to attack (def=use weapon range)
;
; Image = name of graphic data to use for this object 
;   (def=same as object identifier) (ie FENC, DOME, WEAP, SPY, etc)
;
; Invisible = Is completely and always invisible to enemy (def=no)?
;   NOTE: this pretty much makes the unit out-of-hand! VERY unbalancing.
;
; Owner = who can build this (Allies or Soviet) (def="allies,soviet")
;   NOTE: use only allies, soviets OR allies,soviets (for All)
;
; Points = point value for scoring purposes (def=0)
;
; Prerequisite = list of buildings needed before this can be manufactured 
;   (def=no requirement) NOTE: that once all these buildings are built, if any
;   of them get destroyed the unit can still be 'produced'
;
; Primary = primary weapon equipped with (def=none)
; Secondary = secondary weapon equipped with (def=none)
;   NOTE: units with primary and secondary weapons that are the SAME 
;   (ie Tanya) fire twice as fast otherwise this is used to give one
;   weapon that can fire against ground units and one weapon to fir 
;   against air units (such as rocket troops and destroyers)
;
; ROT = Rate Of Turn for body (if present) and turret (if present) (def=0)
;   (how fast the vehicle turns itself)
;
; Reload = time delay between reloads (def=0)
;
; SelfHealing = Does the object heal automatically up to half strength 
;   (def=no)? currently only Mammoth tanks & Harvesters have this. 
;   This ability only lets them heal up to the halfway point on thier bar.
;
; Sight = sight range, in cells (def=1)
;   (ie how many shrouded cells the unit reveals and how far it can 'see'
;   enemy units and react to them)
;
; Strength = strength (hit points) of this object
;
; TechLevel = tech level required to build this (-1 means can't build)
;   (def=-1) This is only used in multiplayer and skirmish (although it may
;   be an hinderance to certain solo scenarios - this is unconfirmed)
;   NOTE: a tech level of -1 makes it immpossible to build this unit
;   NOTE: don't bother altering the tech levels of the badger bomber or
;   spy plane. Even if you can build them you can't give them any orders
;   I tried :(
;
; Sensors = Has sensors to detect nearby cloaked objects (def=no)?
;   (sensors detect 'cloaked' units and force those units to 'uncloak' or 
;   surface, currently only ships have sensors (ie gunboat, destroyer, and 
;   cruiser) It would be a bad idea to give these to units that can cloak
;
; DoubleOwned = Can be built/owned by all countries in a multiplayer game 
;   (def=no)? This supersedes the 'side =' attribute during multiplayer
;   games. This how in multi all sides can have Tanyas and Rocket soldiers
;
;  <<< the following applies only to infantry types >>>
;    C4 = Equipped with building sabotage explosives 
;      (presumes Infiltrate is true) (def=no)? Tanyas/Commandos bomb
;    Fraidycat = Is it inherently afraid and will panic easily (def=no)?
;      (run around like an idiot - ie the civilians during battle)
;    Infiltrate = Can it enter a building like a spy or thief (def=no)?
;      (of course only the spy and thief actually DO anything while
;       infiltrating. No C4 + NOT spy or thief = wasted unit)
;    IsCanine = Should special case dog logic be applied to this?
;      (unit sniffs out spies)
;
;  <<< these apply only to moving units (not buildings) >>>
;    Passengers = number of passengers it may carry (def=0)
;      (ie apc's, transports, and chinooks)
;    Speed = speed of this object (n/a for buildings) (def=0)
;      (look at the different speeds of vehicles to get a 'feel'
;       for how fast different units move)
;  <<< these apply only to terrestrial driving vehicle types >>>
;    Crushable = Can it be crushed by a heavy tracked vehicle (def=no)?
;      (hmmm can a Mammoth crush a ranger.....)
;    Tracked = Is this vehicle tracked (as opposed to wheeled) (def=no)?
;      (this is effected only by various terrains)
;    NoMovingFire = The vehicle must stop before it can fire (def=no)?
;      (ie an allied artillery has to stop moving before it fires)
;  <<< the following applies only to building types >>>
;    BaseNormal = Considered for building adjacency checks (def=yes)?
;      (keeps you from laying buildings far apart from one another)
;    Adjacent = distance allowed to place from other buildings (def=1)
;      (how many cells you can place this from other buildings
;       ignored if basenormal=no)
;    Bib = Should the building have an attached bib (def=no)?
;	(ok I'm at a loss on this one?!? perhaps the little 'skirt' on the
;	 base of buildings where vehicles and men emerge out onto?)
;    Capturable = Can this building be infiltrated by a spy/engineer ;	(def=no)?
;    Crewed = Does it contain a crew that can escape (def=no)?
;	(if yes and building is sold or destroyed it COULD produce men)
;    Power = power output (positive for output, negative for drain) (def=0)
;	(ie power plants are positive most other buildings draw power so they
;	 are negative)
;    Powered = Does it require power to function (def=no)?
;	(if this is 'yes' then the building will not 'function' or do what
;	 it is supposed too when your base is suffering from low power)
;    Repairable = Can it be repaired (def=yes)?
;    Storage = the number of credits this building can store (def=0)
;	(ie storage silos and ore processors)
;    Unsellable = Cannot sell this building (even if it can be built)?
;    WaterBound = Is this building placed on water only (def=no)?
;	(ie subpens and naval yards)

; and now the units!

; ASW = Is this an Anti-Submarine-Warfare projectile (def=no)?
; Animates = Does it animate [this means smoke puffs] (def=no)?
; Arcing = Does it have a ballistic trajectory (def=no)?
; Arm = arming delay (def=0)
; Degenerates = Does the bullet strength weaken as it travels (def=no)?
; Dropping = Does it fall from a starting height (def=no)?
; Frames = number of image frames for animation purposes (def=1)
; Gigundo = Is the projectile larger than normal (def=no)?
; High = Can it fly over walls (def=no)?
; Image = image to use during flight
; Inaccurate = Is it inherently inaccurate (def=no)?
; Inviso = Is the projectile invisible as it travels (def=no)?
; Parachuted = Equipped with a parachute for dropping from plane (def=no)?
; Proximity = Does it blow up when near its target (def=no)?
; ROT = Rate Of Turn [non zero implies homing] (def=0)
; Ranged = Can it run out of fuel (def=no)?
; Rotates = Does the projectile have rotation specific imagery (def=no)?
; Shadow = If High, does this bullet need to have a shadow drawn? (def = yes)

; ******* Warhead Characteristics *******
; This is what gives the "rock, paper, scissors" character to the game.
; It describes how the damage is to be applied to the target. The
; values should take into consideration the 'area of effect'.
; example: Although an armor piercing tank round would instantly
; kill a soldier IF it hit, the anti-infantry rating is still
; very low because the tank round has such a limited area of
; effect, lacks pinpoint accuracy, and acknowledges the fact that
; tanks pose little threat to infantry that take cover.

; Spread = damage spread factor [larger means greater spread] (def=1)
;   (A value of 1 means the damage is halved every pixel distant from
;    center point, a value of 2 means damage is halved every 2 pixels, etc.)
; Wall = Does this warhead damage concrete walls (def=no)?
; Wood = Does this warhead damage wood walls (def=no)?
; Ore = Does this warhead destroy ore (def=no)?
; Verses = damage value verses various armor types (as percentage of
;    full damage)... -vs- none, wood (buildings), light, heavy, concrete
; Explosion = which explosion set to use when warhead of this type impacts
;    (def=0)   0=none, 1=piff, 2=piffs, 3=fire, 4=frags, 5=pops, 6=nuke
; InfDeath = which infantry death animation to use (def=0)
;    0=instant die, 1=twirl die, 2=explodes, 3=flying death, 4=burn death, 5=electro

; ******* Land Characteristics *******
; This section specifies the characteristics of the various
; terrain types. The primary purpose is to differentiate the
; movement capabilities.

; Float = % of full speed for ships [0 means impassable] (def=100)
; Foot = % of full speed for foot soldiers [0 means impassable] (def=100)
; Track = % of full speed for tracked vehicles [0 means impassable] (def=100)
; Wheel = % of full speed for wheeled vehicles [0 means impassable] (def=100)
; Buildable = Can buildings be built upon this terrain (def=no)?

; ******* Random Crate Powerups *******
; This specifies the chance for the specified crate powerup to appear
; in a 'random' crate. The chance is expressed in the form of 'shares'
; out of the total shares specified. The second parameter is the animation
; to use when this crate is picked up. The third parameter, if present,
; specifies the data value needed for that crate powerup. They mean
; different things for the different powerups.

; ******* Mission Control *******
; This specifies the various general behavior characteristics of
; the missions that objects can be assigned. Each of the game objects must
; be in a mission. The mission behavior is generally hard coded into
; the program, but there are some behavior characteristics that can
; be overridden. Don't modify these.

; NoThreat = Is its weapons disabled and thus ignored as a potential
;   target until fired upon (def=no)?
; Zombie = Is forced to sit there like a zombie and never recovers (def=no)?
; Recruitable = Can it be recruited into a team or base defense (def=yes)?
; Paralyzed = Is the object frozen in place but can still fire and
;   function (def=no)?
; Retaliate = Is allowed to retaliate while on this mission (def=yes)?
; Scatter = Is allowed to scatter from threats (def=yes)?
; Rate = delay between normal processing (larger = faster game,
;   less responsiveness)
; AARate = anti-aircraft delay rate (if not specifed it uses regular rate).

; Unit sits still and plays dead.
