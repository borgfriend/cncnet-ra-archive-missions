1. Introduction
---------------

Read the file INTRO.TXT for the full introduction.

2. Files in this campaign
-------------------------

The files are:

MISSION.INI
RULES.INI
TUTORIAL.INI
INTRO.TXT
README.TXT
ERASEDOG.EXE
INSTALL.EXE
DOGSWAR.ZIP
PROBLEMS.TXT
SCG[1-14]EA or EB.ini - Missions

3. Counterstrike?
-----------------

If you have Counterstrike, good.  You will be able to see the true
unit names.  However, this is not essential for playing the missions.

4. Installation
---------------

Simply run INSTALL.EXE - there should be no problems with it.
Move all the files into your Red Alert directory before you unzip it.
Also make sure that you have PKUNZIP in your path directory before you
run INSTALL.EXE.

To play the missions, select

Start New Game
Difficulty - Medium
Side - Allies

Make sure that you use the Allied side, because that is where the
missions are stored.

To remove all of the missions (but not the saved games), run ERASEDOG.EXE.

5. Mission Difficulty
---------------------

The missions are scaled.  This means that the mission go from very easy
at the beginning (where you can win without touching anything) to very
hard (where there is a time limit or more than one enemy).

6. Secrets
----------

There are a few secrets in the missions.  But they aren't very important,
so I don't know why I even mentioned them.

7. Timeline
-----------

Read INTRO.TXT for the details.

8. Problems with Missions
-------------------------

None.  Nada.  Zip.  They have all been spotted by the legendary beta-
testers.  In the unlikely case that there is even a tiny problem, do not
hesitate to e-mail me at luibr@hkstar.com

9. Troubleshooting
------------------

What do I look like, a field medic?  There shouldn't be any problems,
because they will have been spotted by the legendary beta-testers.

10. ^(%#^) MIX files!
---------------------

I give up.  After two days of fighting with these infernal files, I decided
to make the missions separate.  They should not clog up your hard drive,
though, because you can use the uninstall program to get rid of them.
[Note:  MIX files are used in order to combine several smaller files into a
large file for ease of use.  It scores style points.]

And I would like to thank my mom for...
---------------------------------------

I would like to thank Andrew Griffin for inspiring me to make this
mission set, and letting me pilfer his readme file, and creating the
mission guide, and 'inspiring' one mission, and answering my
question, and...
I would also like to thank the playtesters for pointing out things
in my missions, and suggesting some cool things and names, and offering
emotional support, and sending encouraging e-mails, and looking at the
mission code, and helping me get this project off the ground, without
whose help this campaign would never have been possible.
I'd like to thank Ragnar for encouraging me when I was feeling low.
I'd like to thank the people who host the Oscar Awards for giving
me a framework in which to express my thanks and letting me
ramble on and on and on while still seeming to be focused.
