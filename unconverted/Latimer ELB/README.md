**Description:** A sector has been discovered where the ore regenerates quite rapidly. It is very important that the Soviets control this area. Unfortunately, the allies have beaten us to it. France and Germany have teamed up to mine the ore. Germany controls the off-shore operation, while France controls on-shore. You must first disable the off-shore facilities by destroying the German tech center. It is located in the northwest corner of the map. You must then destroy the German naval base. This will help slow down the naval assaults. Finally, destroy all of France&apos;s units and structures.
