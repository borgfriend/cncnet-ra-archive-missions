Beach Landing Mission

====================================================================================
====================================================================================

Ok, now this is in no way a remake of the Normandy invasion, the game engine makes it hard to do something like that, But it is a beach and you are fighting the German house so just imagine that it's d-day ;) Any helpful hints or comments that could help me improve it are welcome. This is not yet done; I have a few more things to add and some polishing to do. When I tested it I found it to be a little easy so maybe I will make it harder.

Also, I would suggest running this on a slower speed than normal. You will have to juggle a few tasks at once and it is also more enjoyable if you slow it down so you can watch things happen. At least run it slow the first few times you play. I really would like you to notice what happens and that gets hard when the game is running fast.
