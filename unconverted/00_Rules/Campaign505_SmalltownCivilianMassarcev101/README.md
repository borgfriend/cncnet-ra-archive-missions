Flaps.zip includes following files:
   Scg01ea.ini 		- single player level data
   Tutorial.ini		- in-game text
   Mission.ini          - boring plots for frisky levels 
   Rules.ini		- oh, you know... but it HAS to be here!!!
   Buttwipe.doc         - you are reading it, buttwipe.

   
*NOTE* Savegame was not included;
			1) It makes the download to long, (10000Mb)
			2) It is VERY easy to run level with out 
			   it, then make your own savegame.  After which you 				   can just delete the file scg01ea.ini

To use:
   Just unzip this zipfile in your Red Alert directory, and run Red Alert. Then start the new Game with Allies. *BUT* use Soviet CD or you wont see the videos- I know it’s fucked up, but the soviet videos seemed more appropriate.
   
Briefing:
   Simple really, just kill all the civilians before they get pissed-off and start detonating their suicide bombs. There’s more tedious info in the in-game briefing, but that’s about all there is to it.

Start of mission: You get a load of ‘experimental’ converted flame-tanks to kick some unarmed civilian butt- these have unlikely names and need to be tested out before used in anger. You also get a mobile SAM launcher to fight-off those pesky Soviet air attacks.

**NOTE**
Although this level requires RA 1.07e to work properly, (download this patch from most decent RA sites) if you have downloaded any extra *.mix files such as CCRA.mix- files with additional graphics and icons, you must disable or move them for the SAM-Launcher to look right. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, then fine.

Enjoy this level & feel free to E-mail me with comments.
