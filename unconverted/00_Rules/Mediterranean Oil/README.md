THIS ONE'S A BITCH! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! 
I don't want anyone writing email complaining that its 
too hard.  

Mission Title:  Mediterranean Oil
     Which CD:  Allies
       Player:  Allies (Germany)
         Type:  Single

Synopsis -
This is the first mission I ever created.  It was made
with GBRAedit version 1.2.3. It was made to illustrate
what can be done with GBRAedit, and what RA is really 
capable of, using custom missions. RA doesn't have to
look like a game (C'mon! Running over infantry?), and
missions DO NOT have to be wimpy.

This mission has just about everything. Reinforcement
teams for both sides, traps, pitfalls, swindles, and one
helluva bad-ass enemy!  You are gonna have to deal with
enemy paratroopers, migs, cruisers, and of course 
land units. Watch out for booby traps too!

You have 3 ways to lose, and only one way to win.
You're gonna make numerous attempts to get it right if
you are determined enough.  There are plenty of ways to
go wrong, and only a few to go right.  Just keep trying.
It CAN be beaten! You are gonna have to do some balls
out guns blazing toe to toe, and you're gonna need to 
do some very careful and intricate surgery too.

RULES.INI has been modified only slightly.  

  You will not be able to run over enemy infantry 
  with vehicles. 

  Artillery range has been increased slightly. 

  Your nuke has been slightly improved. 

The emphasis is on realism without digging real deep
into RULES.INI.

One thing for sure: You'll find this mission interesting,
and one helluva challenge.  But be warned... this one's
tough!  If you need a hint, send email, but only if
you really have tried and can't figure it out.
