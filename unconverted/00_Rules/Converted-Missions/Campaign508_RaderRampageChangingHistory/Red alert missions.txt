These are single player missions for regula rA, named as scg07ea & scg08ea.ini &eb.

HOW TO PLAY?

Run Red alert, start new game and play until mission 7! Unless you have saved game.
I was just tired to rename them to scg01&2, because I have big RA project going on,
and these missions will be included in it.
