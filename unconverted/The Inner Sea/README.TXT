To play this new single player :
	*Unzip the file in a directory
	*copy mission.ini, tutorial.ini and scg01ea.ini

is a very hard level. The computer is really clever and
you'll have a hard time winning.

must destroy the cruiser before the soviet can produce
this unit and then rescue the amiral by capturing the 
tech center, eventually destroy all other soviet
buildings and units.
