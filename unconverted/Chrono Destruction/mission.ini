6=We have couple of thieves near this location, what helps us to gain some extra credits

5=now, they must be kept intact until Allied Demolition Trucks are destroyed.@@
6=Trucks are being produced in western base. Our resources are tight right now, 
7=unfortunately, MCV couldn't be delivered at this time. Instead, use your MIG aircrafts

6=Probably there is, if we can capture allied Tech Center. We can have allied
