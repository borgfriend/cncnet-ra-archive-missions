Description: My second rockin` Red Alert single-player mission. Use your
small but cool team to infiltrate soviet nuclear silo. You have 10 mins to
do that before soviet base will turn into the nuclear hell. You`ll get a Colt
shooting spies, tanya, and gauss-gunners.

Intelligence Briefing:
Infiltrate soviet nuclear silo before 14th scuadron of nuclear bombers will
arrive.

Tips:
Desroy power plants first, or tesla coil will fry yer ass!
Be careful!
