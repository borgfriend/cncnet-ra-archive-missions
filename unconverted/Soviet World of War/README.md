**Description:** The Soviets have large military bases in this region. They have stole our technology, so get your spy into their Technology Centre so we stop them from building our technology and we can deploy our MCVs. Once done, the Soviets will not give up attacks when they discover you. It has also been reported that Ukraine is in this area. From then on, destroy all Soviets.
