Briefing:
========

The Soviets and their allies have established a beachead on Greek land. Your mission is to detroy the beachead, wipe out the Ukranians base, and finally to remove the main soviet base. You will have some help along the way as HQ has sent some ships to assist you and promises reinforcements. We have also learned how to build some Soviet units which may help. There is a French forward base in the area which is currently under attack by the Soviets.


Credits:

I would like to thank the following, without whose efforts, this would not have been possible:

Andrew Griffin and Charles Francis Harkins for their comprehensive Red Alert Single Mission Creation Guide (release 1.0 March 5, 1997). How did they find out all that detailed information?

Gavin Pugh for his Red Alert Scenario Creation guide and Triggers and Teamtypes Guide. (Both V1.04, Feb 16,1997) and for R.A.C.K. BETA v0.12. A major accomplishment!

Everyone else on the net for their missions and RA editing information.

Comments:
========

I worked very hard (and learned a lot about mission creation) in building this level. Many hours of play testing went into this version. I am still tuning the mission because the end seems a little too easy compared to the challenging beginning and middle action. So, I will provide an updated version with a more challenging ending soon.

I am currently writing a step-by-step description of how I developed this mission: what I did in what order, tools used, things I learned, things to avoid, things that didn't work, etc.... This will be available shortly.

I hope you enjoy it. Have fun!
