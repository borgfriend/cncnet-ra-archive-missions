**Description:** The Soviets and their allies have established a beachead on Greek land. Your mission is to detroy the beachead, wipe out the Ukranians base, and finally to remove the main soviet base. You will have some help along the way as HQ has sent some ships to assist you and promises reinforcements. We have also learned how to build some Soviet units which may help. There is a French forward base in the area which is currently under attack by the Soviets.
