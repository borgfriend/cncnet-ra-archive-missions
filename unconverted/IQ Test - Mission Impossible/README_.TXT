Mission Overview
----------------
This is the final test!  The ultimate single player mission for the
master strategist. Knowledge of the original Red Alert units and
structures, their capabilities and construction pre-requisites will
serve you much better than rapid-fire reflexes on the mouse.

Your mission brief is simple enough: as the Allied commander, you must
eliminate all Soviet forces on the battlefield. The enemy is rather
passive, he doesn't produce units, and rarely ventures near your base.
So don't expect a lot of action-packed combat. Better still, you don't
need to waste time scouting: so long as you proceed in a logical
manner, all relevant goals and hazards for each stage will be
revealed to you ahead of time. Sound simple so far?  Well, wait until
you see the Soviet base fortifications!  And there's very little in the
way of ore, so money will be tight. Oh yes, did I tell you..... there's
a time limit, so you'll be racing against the clock.

None of the RULES.INI settings have been changed, so you won't have to
worry about dogs firing Tesla bolts, indestructible submarines, or
mammoth tanks that travel at 200 miles an hour. There's no ants or
other Counterstrike variations, either. It's all standard stuff. And
there's not too many starting units, or game triggers, so your PC
response time should be pretty good.

I'm in a generous mood, so I'll offer some more words of advice. A brute
force approach - tank rushes, nuclear strikes, chronoshifted cruisers -
is simply not possible, and wouldn't help you much in any case. In fact,
you can win with just a handful of units..... if you read the on-screen
briefing carefully before you begin. Beyond that, this mission is not a
"trick question", just a test of your ability to campaign logically and
use your resources, and RA knowledge, to the fullest effect.

Good luck, commander. A win is definitely possible - I've achieved it
during play-testing, with more than 24 minutes and $2900 to spare, and
losing only 4 units in the process. If you do manage to succeed, e-mail
me (dave@bsnz.co.nz) your final score, and (if you want me to take you
seriously) details of your winning strategy.
