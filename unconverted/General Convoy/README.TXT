Red Alert Single Player Scenario - By Richard Ling
--- ----- ------ ------ --------

Name:           GENERAL CONVOY

Objective:      Destroy enemy and convoy

Description:

  This is a level for the allies and is called "General Convoy". 
  You start with a base already built up and with quite a few tanks. Your 3
ore trucks, in the bottom right, will automatically start to harvest. But the
only way to get to the ore is by going to the centre of the map. There are 4
convoy trucks and a lot of mammoth tanks, plus defences. The mission will end
when all the Soviets are destroyed.
