Red Alert Single Player Scenario - By Richard Ling
--- ----- ------ ------ --------

Name:           NAVAL ASSISTANT

Objective:      Wipe out enemy

Description:

  This is a level for the allies and is called "Naval Assistant". Basically,
you have to wipe out the enemy so that a new naval outpost can be built as
Stalin destroyed the last one.
  You start with quite a few tanks, 3 artillerys, 3 rangers and 2 MCV's. Plus
you get 4 destroyers and 1 cruiser. There are 5 normal sized islands and 3
very small ones. The island that you start on has been secured by your allies
the French and they have built a small base consisting of a power plant, a
barracks and 3 pill boxes. This is to the left of your starting force. Each
bridge is guarded by pill boxes and rangers. Also to the left are two soviet
mammoth tanks. The lower one begins attacking the French base and the upper
one attacks a pill box by the bridge. There is a mine on the two nearest
bridges, one below the trees on the road, and one to the right of the trees
on the road. The soviets have bases on 3 of the islands; the top left, the
top middle and the lower left. There are also a lot of submarines. The soviets
also have a lot of air power. Sometimes if paratroopers land in your base
the French will come to assist. There is not really a lot of ore, so use it
wisely.

Credits:        I wouldnt have been able to make this level without the help
                of Peter Simpson (E-Mail: MouseGlued@aol.com). He was the
                one who put the triggers in for me. There are also a few levels
                of his on my web site.
