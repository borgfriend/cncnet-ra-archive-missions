**Author:** Spike35
**Staff rating:** n/a

**Description:** Secure your area and start base, and set up ground and air defense all around. Once discovered expect frequent ground and air attacks.  Once set up, send a force south to free the prisoners and insure both flame towers and missile silo are destroyed.  Drop airborne troops behind sovyet lines to get crates for quick cash. Try to get spies into the pravda, kgb, bio, and tesla control buildings to gain advantage.  MAIN objective is the destruction of the kremlin in Red Square. That will crush the commies and stalin for good.
