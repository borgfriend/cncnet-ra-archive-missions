JACKPOT MISSION - VERSION 1.1
*****************************

This is a single player mission that can be played in Command & Conquer: Red Alert 
(This mission is compatible with any version of Red Alert including the freeware version and The First Decade compilation pack.)


TO PLAY THIS MISSION:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1) Unzip Jackpot1.zip to any directory on your hard drive for safekeeping. In this 
directory you will now have two files:

	scu-0001.mix 
	readme.txt


2) Copy-and-paste scu-0001.mix into your Red Alert directory. Your Red Alert directory
is typically located at C:\Westwood\Redalert


3) Start Red Alert. At the main menu, click on 'Start New Game'. At the Difficulty 
Setting menu, select 'Normal'. At the Choose Your Side menu, select 'Soviet'.


4) Read the entire briefing carefully. (Optional)


5) Play. 



TO RETURN RED ALERT BACK TO DEFAULT SOVIET MISSIONS:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Delete scu-0001.mix from your Red Alert directory.

That's it.



BRIEFING:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK General. This is a tough assignment. We're low on funds and we're currently under heavy fire. We're dropping you in with one of our latest developments ~ an X2-MTUSK. When you go on point to do grunt work though be advised that once you get wasted, it's 'game over'. Your mission is to eliminate the initial threat to our base and then attempt to locate enough resources to build a tech center. Once it's built, we'll be able to send in another of our latest developments. Our operatives in the field will keep you apprised of enemy movements. A base in the SW corner is a real party pooper. Our agents can temporarily blow the base defenses but we need someone to rush in and take down the main factory. One of our best operatives was wounded and captured behind enemy lines. If you could liberate her she could be of great assistance. Also, we just received a very fuzzy transmission that we think is of considerable  importance. The only thing we could make out was the word 'Jackpot.' More to follow...



FAIR WARNING:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) This is a Soviet vs. Soviet mission. (Allied countries play small subsidiary roles.)
2) Free parabombs from the airfield option is disabled.
3) Free para-infantry from the airfield option is disabled.
4) MiG aircraft will be inaccessible to player (the enemy however will wield them relentlessly.)
5) The Tech Center will cost $10,000 (but it'll be worth every penny.)
6) Some civilians are well armed and very dangerous (this may occasionally work in your favour.)
7) Mammoth tank secondary weapon is rapid-fire (this will definitely work in your favour.)
8) Some areas are heavily mined (anti-tank).
9) Using the spy plane will greatly increase your chances of success.




ABOUT THIS MISSION:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I created the map from scratch and wrote up the entire mission from scratch. If you're familiar with Red Alert modding then you probably already know about all the following tools and guides I used to put the whole thing together:


1) The Red Alert Single Player Mission Creation Guide - Release 1.1 - May 28, 1997 
2) Step-by-Step Red Alert Single Player Mission Creation Tutorial 
3) Red Alert Terrain Editor (comes with Red Alert installation CD) 
4) Gavin Pugh's R.A.C.K. version 1, Beta 4 
5) RA-Mixer 5.13 (to extract and study original game files of which the most informative was rules.ini located in redalert.mix) 


I've played numerous other single player missions that various people have created and it's quite evident that some authors fail to test-play their missions straight through from 'Start New Game' to 'Mission Accomplished'. Therefore I took the time and effort to test-play this mission straight through to completion many times. I also varied my approach by trying all kinds of wacky strategies and base designs to do my best to leave no stone unturned. 

I'd be very interested if:


A) You have found a way to cheat around one or more of the mission's main objectives.

B) You have found some kind of glitch that prevents you from completing the mission. 

C) You're just plain stuck and need some help with your strategy.
