Commando mission for Red Alert Readme file
==========================================

Firstly thanks for downloading this mission.  This is an attempted recreation of the first GDI
Commando mission from C&C (mission 6).  It is not exact, as I could not remember the terrain 
exactly, and I don't have the mission creation knowlage to make every single trigger and 
teamtype that there was, but I think you'll find it fun anyway.  As usuall, you have to take out 
loads of SAM sites to help your chopper along, and the objective is different, you have to 
destroy all buildings in the area, not just the airfield as you did in the old C&C mission.
You do, however, get the old C&C Commando to use, thanks to Chuck replacing the pallette and 
anlarging the images for the commando, which I have simply extracted from his mix file.

Instructions
------------
Simply unzip this file and copy these files into your RedAlert directory 
(usually C:\WESTWOOD\REDALERT):

			sc-999.mix
			rules.ini
			scg01ea.ini
			mission.ini
			tutorial.ini

Then start a new game as the Allies.

Note: most missions will only have the last two files, but this mission uses a rules.ini edit 
(the Commando) and a mix file with the Commando image in.

BUGS
----
1.There is a power plant in the base which overlaps with another plant.  You can destroy it, 
just try coming in from a variety of angles.
2.For some SAD reason I now can't open this mission in RACK, so can't add any more units to it (unless I do it 
the old traditional way of making loads of waypoints and cell refs - which I can't be bothered 
to do), so if you can open it, tell me what you have to do so I can add a few more units which I 
want to do.

Don't really know any others.
