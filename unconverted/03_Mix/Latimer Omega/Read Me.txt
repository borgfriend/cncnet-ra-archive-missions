INTRODUCTION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
As usual, I have tried to add something new to my latest creation. This
time, I have added new units. 2 structures and 2 aircraft. 1 structure is
used only by the computer. Once again, this mission hasn't been fully 
play-tested. But it should work fine. If you find ANY bugs please E-mail
me.   TESTED ON P5-133, 16 MB, 6X

PROGRAMS USED:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
RACK 1.0 beta 2 and Overlay tiles from Gavin Pugh
Team and Trigs editor 1.2 by Frank Edling
Andrew Griffin's guide
RA-MIXer by Moritz Mertinkat
CCMIX by Chris Groenveld

THEME:  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The battle has been raging for months. The allies are starting to gain
momentum now that they have Magnum Artillery units and airfields. They
have blocked our only route to the southern ore fields, we're low on 
credits, and there is little ore near our base. Luckily, the military
is sending in high tech reinforcements. You will be in charge of our
new technology. Build up our base and create an air force. You will
need a tech center and an aircraft control tower. Use these new units
to help move our ore mining facilities to the northeast area of the 
mountain. Take over the abandoned barracks and start production. From
this area the southern ore fields are accessible. Once this is done,
begin our offensive! Tanya is over-seeing the battle in the allied
base. Do your best to kill her! We also require you to capture their
tech center so we can gain whatever technology that they have. Once
this is done, destroy all allied units and structures!
