You then get a full briefing on your mission. A soviet soldier is near the exit from the elevator...only one option, kill him. You now start your mission. The Soviets have taken over the famous Lyle Compound, an Allied base which exists only to make technical and biological advancements for the Allied forces.

To play the .INI version of my new mission, copy SCG01EA.INI and MISSION.INI into the Red Alert folder on your hard drive.

Now, start either version of Red Alert.  Start a new game as the
Allies.  That's all you have to do.
