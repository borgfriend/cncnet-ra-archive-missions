INTRODUCTION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my biggest mission yet. I tried to cram as many trigs in as I 
could. Hopefully everything works. It hasn't been fully play-tested yet.
I don't think there are any problems though. But if you do find anything
wrong, please E-mail me. That would include if you find a way to win 
without going through all of the proper steps  :) Also, if there is 
anything you think the mission really needs, tell me about it! 

THEME:  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Stalin has re-captured Einstein. You have to rescue him. And then go 
after Stalin! This will take a number of steps. Many of the instructions
will be "radioed" to you (text). Follow these instructions! They will
help greatly. Go get them!

INCLUDED FILES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Read Me.txt (this document)
scg01ea.ini  (the new scenario)
mission.ini  (the new mission briefing) note: the briefing is now in the
	     scg01ea.ini file, but you MUST HAVE the empty mission.ini 
	     file in the RA folder for it to work properly.
tutorial.ini (the new text)

INSTALLATION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Just place the "scg01ea.ini" file, the "tutorial.ini" and the "mission.ini"
 file in the same directory that RED ALERT is in.  Then start RED ALERT.  Select
"NEW GAME".  You should choose normal difficulty.  Then select Allies
and my mission is loaded.  

UNINSTALLATION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Just place the files in a different directory.
