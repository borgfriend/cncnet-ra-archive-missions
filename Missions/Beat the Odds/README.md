Eliminate the roadblock and kill the German general for his information about the locations of the German base and a nearby Ukranian base. Find them, you'll need their Anti-Aircraft tanks. Get past the Germans to get to the only beach with clear access to the ocean. Make sure to destroy all of their units and structures. Go across to the English side, and capture their Tech Center. Finally, wipe out the English! Watch out for the improved allied Cammo Pillboxes! To balance them, you have improved YAKs and naval resources. Your MCV can also be redeployed. The odds are against you, but we know you can beat them!

Gavin Pugh for his Red Alert Scenario Creation guide and Triggers and Teamtypes Guide. (Both V1.04, Feb 16,1997) and for R.A.C.K. BETA v0.13.

Everyone else on the net for their missions and RA editing information.

Comments:
========

I tried out some new things in building this level. Many,many hours of play testing went into this version. The only remaining problem that this mission has is that the reinformcent crusiers always seem to want to go back to thier initial waypoint after a little while. If anyone knows how to get the team to enter the map as a reinforcement and not display this behavior, please let me know.

I hope you enjoy it. Have fun!
