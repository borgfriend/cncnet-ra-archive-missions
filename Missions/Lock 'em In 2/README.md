Red Alert Single Player Scenario - By Richard Ling
--- ----- ------ ------ --------

Name:           LOCK 'EM IN: RETALLIATION

Objective:      Protect all bridges, keep all structures intact, protect
                Tanya and the Generals, destroy enemy.

Full Briefing:

   Good job with the last mission! We captured that supply depots by bringing
chinooks and engineers. We repaired the bridges and our tank force has arrived.
Now this base is invaluable. But Stalin made an unexpected move. He has
diverted 3 assault convoys to destroy the depot. It seems if he cant have it,
no-one can. We know that 2 8-V2 convoys are approaching from the north. 1 convoy,
approaching from the south has an unknown amount of V2's and Mammoth Tanks. But
we expect the number of Mammoth Tanks to be very low, as most of his force
guards Moscow. Keep all the structures intact. We need them now. Keep at least
one bridge intact so we have access to the base. Tany and 2 Generals are still
at the base and were unable to escape. Keep them alive! If you dont, you will
fail. Your tank force is very limited as we under-estimated Stalin's response
to us capturing his base.

Description:

  This is a level for the allies and is called "Lock 'Em In: Retalliation".
This is the sequel to "Lock 'Em In". Same map as before, but now the base is
yours, and Stalin is attacking with more than just a commando.
