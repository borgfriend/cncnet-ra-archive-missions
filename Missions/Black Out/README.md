Red Alert Single Player Scenario - By Ben and Richard Ling
--- ----- ------ ------ --------

Name:           BLACK OUT

Objective:      Wipe out enemy

Description:

  This is a level for the allies and is called "Black Out". Basically,
you have to wipe out an enemy base called "The Black Out Base". It is
equiped with radar jamming and communictaions blocking equipment and so
it must be destroyed.
  This is not an island map. You start with 15 tanks, 5 of which are mammoth
tanks, 4 artillerys, 2 rangers, 2 mobile gap generators and 2 MCVs. You will
find that sometimes this mission can be very hard. You come under attack
almost straight away, so get your tanks to the right side of your base (you
start in the top left corner and the Soviets start on the bottom. Yes, the
whole of the bottom!). Get your base up and running as soon as posible. A
War Factory being the priority here. You have 20,000 cash, so there is no
limit to what you can buy to start with. He will very quickly, churn out
tanks and troops. If this is too hard then edit the file SCG01EA.INI to suit
your wimpish needs. Your main target here are the power plants. Most of
his stuff will be disabled once there is no power. He has 2 tesla coils, and
loads of gap generators.
