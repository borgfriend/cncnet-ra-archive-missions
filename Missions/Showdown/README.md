The ShowDown!!!

Made by Rob Nickel

1 Mammoth Tank VS. 300 civillians

Who will win? You decide.
Start a new Allied game to play as the mammoth tank
Start a new Soviet game to play as 300 civillians

just extract the zip folder to your Red Alert directory and you are ready to go!

I played both sides tons of times and the civillians always win, if you can win with the mammoth tank please tell me!
