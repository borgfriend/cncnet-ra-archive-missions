This is a new Soviet Mission (not just a map) for Red Alert.

To play it, just copy SCU01EA.INI and MISSION.INI from the zip
file to the Red Alert directory.  Then just start a new Soviet game.

I extracted the last Soviet mission from MAIN.MIX, and changed
it around a bit, and this new mission is the ending result.

Inside the SCU01EA.INI file is a  "mini" rules.ini file that can be
used along with the "normal" rules.ini file. You must have a rules.ini
in the Red Alert directory for this to work.  Here's what was changed:
What the "mini" rules.ini does, is override the main rules.ini for this
specific mission and not the entire game.  I changed the values for
the objects below to make the mission less difficult (especially at
the beginning.

SCUD Launcher			Mammoth Tank
Also fires Dragon Rockets		Strength is now 750 (was 600)
Strength is now 175 (was 150)		Speed is now 6 (was 4)
Costs 800 credits (was 700)		Sight is now 7 (was 6)
				Costs 1950 credits (was 1700)

This mission is not compatible wth Red Alert for Win95.  It will only work
with the DOS version of Red Alert.  If you get it to work in the Win95 edition,
e-mail me.
