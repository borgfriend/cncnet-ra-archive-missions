**Description:** Once you win the mission, the confirmation code will pop up, so have a pen and paper ready.  If you can tell me the correct confirmation code, as well as how long it took you to beat the mission, and what difficulty level you beat the mission in, you will be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Good luck!
