MISSION BRIEFING:
Our small base in the south-west sector has been under
constant fire from allied forces. Your mission is to 
reinforce this base and launch an attack on the Allied
base in the north-east. Erase it from the map and
terminate all remaining opposition.
Remarks:
You have 2 improved units under your command.
 -Grenadiers ($1000): they carry 1 nuclear grenade and selfdestroy after
  reaching the target.
 -Scud ($900): larger range and improved rate of fire.
Your troups should avoid the nuclear waste compound in the north-west.
The materials -stored in reinforced concrete barrels- are rather volatile.
An 'accident' might prove fatal to your troops.
