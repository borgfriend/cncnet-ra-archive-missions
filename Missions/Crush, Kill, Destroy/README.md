INTRODUCTION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first mission I have made.  I have gone a little crazy with
the whole thing.  I put a lot of units and buildings into it.  I 
apologize if it runs slow on anyones machine (I tested it on a P-166 w/
16MB of RAM and it ran a little slow every now and then).  I would 
love to hear your feedback!  Also, you should visit my Web Site.  I 
have a Red Alert Page that has everything you need.  Have fun!

THEME:  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Stalin's men have found and rescued him after you tore through
Moscow.  He has gathered a huge army and is standing strong!  Your job
is to take the Science base we provided you, and turn it into the 
ultimate base!  Kill Stalin (in the Command Center) and finish off the 
Reds for good!

INCLUDED FILES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
CKD Read Me.txt (this document)
scg01ea.ini  (the new scenario)
mission.ini  (the new mission briefing)

INSTALLATION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Just place the "scg01ea.ini" file in the same directory as RED ALERT is
in (make sure you do not have a file called "rules.ini" in the same 
directory, it would be cheating!).  Then start RED ALERT.  Select
"NEW GAME".  You should choose normal difficulty.  Then select Allies
and my mission is loaded.  Enjoy the Movies!

UNINSTALLATION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Just place the files in a different directory (i.e. a folder called
New Mission, etc.  Not Recycle Bin Please :-)  Thanks)

LAST WORDS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I will tell you there are a lot of Subs!  And look out for the MIGS, 
too.  I would like to thank:  The makers of "THE RED ALERT SINGLE 
PLAYER CREATION GUIDE", Courtney Bunker (for listening to my
complaints), Westwood Studios, Microsoft NotePad,God, My Family, and 
last, but not least you for downloading! Visit my web site at the 
address at the top of the page! E-Mail Me any Questions or Comments! 
Thanks!
