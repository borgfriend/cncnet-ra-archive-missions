This file is to explain Death Island, which is my first
Red Alert mission.

Objectives:
Capture a former Soviet base so you can use it as your own.
Take over Death Island.  KILL ALL ALLIES!!!

Things that happen:
You'll get a MCV after you capture the radar dome.  You'll need
it.  Lots of reinforcments happen with the triggers.

Bugs:
There shouldn't be many.  If you find one or two BIG problems,
let me know.  I know little things, like sometimes the AI won't
produce right and men will be everywhere and stuff like that.
None of that should bee too big a deel.

Hints:
Start taking over that island ASAP!  The longer you wait, the
more opponents are created.  Making it harder to beet.
