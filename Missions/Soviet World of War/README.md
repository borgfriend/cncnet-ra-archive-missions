**Date added:** 15-Mar-2003
**Author:** Andy Vinall
**Staff rating:** n/a

**Description:** The Soviets have large military bases in this region. They have stole our technology, so get your spy into their Technology Centre so we stop them from building our technology and we can deploy our MCVs. Once done, the Soviets will not give up attacks when they discover you. It has also been reported that Ukraine is in this area. From then on, destroy all Soviets.

Soviet World of WAR - Aftermath Mission created by Andy Vinall
--------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You need Red Alert: The Aftermath to play this mission.

Files packed with this Zip File:

Scg01ea.ini
Tutorial.ini
Mission.ini
Readme.txt

Instructions
------------
Unzip the files into your Red Alert Directory (Default is C:\WESTWOOD\Redalert\).
Start up Red Alert and goto New Game, then select your skill (Easy, Normal or Hard)
and then choose your side to be Allies. The Mission should start.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Question (Q): The computer locks up when I try the mission. Why?
Answer (A): There are many possible problems that occur with that.
1#: You haven't Unzipped all off the files to the Red Alert Directory.
2#: You haven't deleted Rules.ini and Aftrmath.ini (make backups if you want to).
3#: You don't have the Aftermath Installed or you don't have it.

If you have problems getting the mission to work, email me (address is down the bottom).
I hope you enjoy my Aftermath Mission. I used C&C Red Alert Scenario Edit V1.24 and Notepad
to create my mission.
