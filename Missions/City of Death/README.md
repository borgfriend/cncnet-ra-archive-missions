**Date added:** 15-Mar-2003
**Author:** FlameWolf
**Staff rating:** n/a

**Description:** Train a spy and locate and infiltrate the nuclear station. Some scientists will then arrive. Use them to infiltrate the technology centre next to the nuclear station. They will try to stabilise it. This should revert everything back to normal. If they fail... you must destroy the town. ALL infantry in the area will be affected in some manner. Use caution when dealing with any type of infantry. Note that the Soviets have also deployed forces to deal with this. The French will be assisting you. Build a chronosphere and we&apos;ll be able to &apos;shift in a large number of reinforcements. Do not allow the nuclear station to be destroyed at any time.
