TO PLAY:
A Bridge Too Far starts off with Tanya going off for reinforcement which 
consists of mainly Infantry Units, a few Medics, and two Generals.
The first part of the mission requires you to try and hold off enemy's 
attack. Most this part has been automated so it doesnot require much on 
your part except to keep Tanya & the Generals alive. I suggest moving them 
to the back of the troops. Also move some units that you may want to keep
alive there as well (where the flare is). In this part you are meant to
lose so don't worry too much! Also try to move the fighting off the bridge
for if it breaks, you lose the mission.

After a while of fighting, Tanya and the Generals will start to retreat North
where you will encounter your prebuilt base. There are most things here
including Ore Refinery, Weapon Factories, Barracks, etc., but no Factories
so you will lose your building for good if destroyed. From here onwards, it's
pretty much Shoot'em up and protect your base...

Enjoy!
