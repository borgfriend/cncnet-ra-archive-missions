This is a big sea and air battle.  You'll be wise to take out
enemy weapons factories, to avoid being crushed.

Play is moderately difficult.

To install, unzip the files into your Red Alert directory.
Then execute AEGEANCO.BAT.  This will copy the files and give
them the extension .INI so that they can be played.

To remove, execute AEGEARmv.bat.  This will reove the INI files
from your directory so that you can play normally.
