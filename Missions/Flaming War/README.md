   We have found the secret base of Soviet's flamethrowers. Rumors abound
   that their new weapon Flaming Missile is nearing completion. It has set
   on their Forward Command Post. An even more powerful version of that
   weapon is also in the works. Destroy quick the Forward Command Post and

   Napalm Bombs!

   Good Luck!
